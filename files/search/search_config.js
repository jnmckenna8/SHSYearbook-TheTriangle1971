I came to the United States by The International Fellowship Inc., a special organization of the exchange students. In these two months and a half, I attended Spaulding High School in the city where I lived. \u000d\u000aThis was the first time that I had seen snow and I liked it very much. Snow is very good but I had many problems with ice \u000d\u000aand water in the streets. New England is very pretty and the people are very' friendly, as Brazilians are.\u000d\u000aI passed these months here as I would in my home because Mr. and Mrs. Earl Packard gave me a life as my parents give \u000d\u000ame in Brazil. I saw many parts of Newr England and did many things that are impossible to do in Brazil such as skiing, driving a skimobile and using a snow-blower.\u000d\u000aThe students of Spaulding High School arc formidable and friendly too. Everyone gave me agreeable moments; these moments I will never forget. Everything that I needed in the small time I was here was given to me. I liked very much this experience, and I think that I made friendships in this time. When I go back to my country I will talk about everything about \u000d\u000athe student of this country. The teachers are very good and make friends with the pupils at the same time that they teach.\u000d\u000aIn Brazil I am a senior and in this year 1971 I will attend the Preparatory School for Medicine College. Before I came \u000d\u000ahere I thought well of the schools in the United States, because I learned in an American magazine how it is in an American \u000d\u000aschool. Now, I can only say that I want to come back here some day, in the future, maybe when I graduate from the School \u000d\u000aof Medicine.

We have always \u000d\u000abeen a hard-hitting short yardage offense. But this year \u000d\u000aSpaulding came closer than ever before to such a reputation. With a backfield, perhaps with more accumulated \u000d\u000ayardage than before and a line making up for lack of size \u000d\u000awith guts and determination in surplus, Spaulding posted \u000d\u000aan admirable 6-3 record. Losing four out of Five pre-season \u000d\u000ascrimmages and dropping the season opener to Keene 22-6 \u000d\u000adidn\u2019t encourage too many fans at first. But a three game \u000d\u000ahome stand witnessed an offense and top-ten in the state \u000d\u000arated defense gel into a Raider machine that rolled over \u000d\u000aPortsmouth (for the first time in six years), Laconia (who \u000d\u000awent on to win Div. II, this being their only loss 34-6), \u000d\u000aand St. Thomas.\u000d\u000aThe one factor that made the big difference lor Spaulding this year, however, was the Red Raider defense. Just \u000d\u000athe fact that they allowed the division winners only one \u000d\u000atouchdown is a tribute to the teamwork, drill precision and \u000d\u000aplain sweat that is a must when a defense rates statewide. \u000d\u000aLed by Seniors Don LaBelle, Loren Clark, John Kilpatrick, \u000d\u000aand Bill Clark at linebacker, defensive end and defensive \u000d\u000atackle respectively, our defense shut out three teams (St. \u000d\u000aThomas, Manchester West, and Somersworth) and held \u000d\u000athree to one touchdown (Portsmouth, Laconia, and Trinity). One fact many don\u2019t realize is that the offense gave up \u000d\u000aalmost as many touchdowns as the defense and the defense \u000d\u000atook the blame.\u000d\u000aWhen the Raiders fell (to Keene, Concord, and Dover), \u000d\u000ait was not the defense but the offense that fell and that is \u000d\u000aalso a tribute. When one thinks back two years to the \u000d\u000aDover \u2014 Spaulding game played here on the mud, one can \u000d\u000afully realize the caliber of the 1970 defense which was essentially the same.\u000d\u000aOne other small fact \u2014 in the four years that the class \u000d\u000aof 1971 has studied at Spaulding, our arch rivals (Somersworth) have been defeated thrice.
